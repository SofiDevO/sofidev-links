### Updating User Links

To customize the links displayed in your application, follow these steps:

1. Open the `src/data.js` file in your project.
2. Locate the section containing the information of the user links (`userLinks`).
3. Modify each object within the `userLinks` array with the information you want to display. You can change the link title, the link itself, and the associated icon.
4. Save the changes in the `data.js` file.

Here's an example of how you can change the information of the links:

```javascript
const userLinks = [
    {
        title: "My website",
        link: "https://mywebsite.com",
        icon: "ant-design:global-outlined"
    },
    {
        title: "Personal blog",
        link: "https://blog.mywebsite.com",
        icon: "fa-solid:book"
    },
    {
        title: "Contact",
        link: "mailto:email@example.com",
        icon: "bi:chat-right-dots"
    },
]
```

5. Once you have updated the information of the links in the `userData.js` file, the changes will be automatically reflected in your application when you rebuild or run it.

Remember to ensure you provide valid links and that the icons used are available in the icon library you are using in your project.

### Including Icons

To import icons into your project, we use the Iconify CDN and utilize the `icon` attribute of each Iconify icon in the `userLinks`. For example, to use an icon of React:

```html
<iconify-icon icon="logos:react" width="27" height="27"></iconify-icon>
```

In our `data.js`, we only need to specify the icon identifier, like this:

```javascript
{
    title: "React",
    link: "https://reactjs.org/",
    icon: "logos:react"
}
```

Here's how you can add the Iconify script to the `<head>` section of your project:

```html
<head>
    <script src="https://code.iconify.design/iconify-icon/2.1.0/iconify-icon.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

Once you include this script, you can use any Iconify icon by specifying its identifier in the `icon` attribute. Make sure to replace `"logos:react"` with the appropriate icon identifier for the icons you want to use. You can find a variety of icons available on the [Iconify logos page](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/logos/).
